1. Set up the environment. I have initialized pipenv environment with `pipenv --python 3.8` and install the required dependencies (Django) `pipenv install django` ![](screens/1.png)
2. Started a new Django project (`django-admin startproject lab3_web_page`) and moved all sources to the directory above. ![](screens/2.png)
